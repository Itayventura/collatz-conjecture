#collatz-conjecture

The algorithm works and validates that each number below 8528817511L is a collatz number.
8528817511L - not known, beacuse we reached out of bound exception.

#statement of the problem
Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

Now form a sequence by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with any positive integer, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next.
The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.
